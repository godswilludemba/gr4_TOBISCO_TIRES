TOBISCO TIRES
This is the mock-website for Tobisco tires. To ensure the success of the site, a good plan will
guide the steps and processes. Tobisco is a local business that intends to reach a large diverse
audience, so the website should serve both informational and marketing purposes. In Nigeria, it
has been largely observed that retail tire businesses do not have online presence, so therefore,
this would be among the first of the many innovations in the business line. This website would
also be of high value to the intending customers, who can now access the shop and order for
goods from any location at their own comfort. And also, it would help both the business owner
and customers interact and send feedback.

functions correctly across different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and
devices (e.g., desktops, smartphones, tablets).
● Performance Evaluation: Testing measures the website's loading speed, responsiveness,
and scalability to ensure it performs well under various conditions and user loads.
● Usability Assessment: User testing and usability testing reveal how easily visitors can
navigate the website, complete tasks, and provide valuable feedback to improve the user
experience.

against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

monitoring for suspicious activities, and implementing security best practices.
● Content Updates. This ensures that the website content remains current, accurate, and
relevant. Add new content, update existing pages, and remove outdated or redundant
information. This helps improve user experience and SEO. This also includes getting
feedback from the users.
● Software Updates. Keep the website's underlying software components (e.g., content
management system, plugins, themes) up to date. Software updates often include bug
fixes, security patches, and performance enhancements.
● Performance Optimization. Monitor and optimize website performance to ensure fast
loading times and efficient use of server resources. This includes optimizing images,
